     * van can get its orders by query Orders collection from db by van_name, if a van wants to query for orders in a specific
     * status like `completed`, query with van_name and 'COMPLETE' in Orders collection.
     *
     * However, If we use these arrays for storing orders , if we want to get these orders' detail,we have to travel all the order id
     * in these arrays, and then call `orders.findOne(order_id)` method for each of id element in array to query id-matched order in
     * Orders collections to get order details, which will make the program travel the database over and over again.
     *
     * On the contrary, if we store van_name in order schema, as is similar to mysql one-to-many relationship, if we want to find a van's
     * orders and their details, just call `orders.find(van_name)` method for once, then this method will travel the database for only one time
     * and returns an array of orders that belong to the customer.
